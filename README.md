## Easy IMU Version 2 (EIMU_V2) Arduino I2C Lib
This library helps communicate with the already setup **`Easy IMU`** with  arduino microcontroller projects via I2C

> you can use it in your Arduino-based robotics project (e.g Arduino UNO, Arduino NANO, Arduino MEGA, Esp32, etc.)

A simple way to get started is simply to try out and follow the example code


## How to Use the Library
- Ensure you have the **`Easy IMU`**

- Download download the library by clicking on the green Code button above (or clone it)
  > if you download it, extract it and change the folder name to `epmc_arduino`

- Move the downloaded library file to your Arduino library folder
  > e.g on linux: ... home/Arduino/libraries/
  >
  > e.g on windows: ... Documents/Arduino/libraries/
  >
  > (or any where your arduino libraries are stored)

- restart your ArduinoIDE and navigate to examples and run the example code and see how to control the motors.

- you can copy this example code into your project and modify it to your taste.
